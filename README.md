# Astrophysical-fluid

This is the repo for Astrophysical Fluid and Plasma's homework and project

## Homework 5

The origin PDF version of the problem can be found [here](http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/classes/fluids/homeworks/homework5.pdf).

Here are the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/chengxi95/Astrophysical-fluid/blob/master/homework5.ipynb) and the [python code](https://github.com/chengxi95/Astrophysical-fluid/blob/master/homework5.py) of my solver. You need to put [riemann.py](https://github.com/chengxi95/Astrophysical-fluid/blob/master/riemann.py) under the same folder of the jupyter notebook or python code to run them.

Below are my simulation for different problems:
